Vectors
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector2.html
- private Vector2 moveVal; -> moveVal is variable of type Vector2, a struct
- moveVal.x = -> set x component of vector
- moveVal.Normalize(); -> sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) != 1, normalize vector so direction is shrunk so that its magnitude = 1
- declaring a variable initializes its values to (0.0, 0.0)
- Vector2 direction = new Vector2(horizontalVal, verticalVal);
    - use of constructor, make new object of a class (csce 121 pain)
    - new Vector2 object created named "direction" initializing the x component to "horizontalVal" and y component to "verticalVal"
    - the same as:
      Vector2 direction = new Vector2();
      direction.x = horizontalVal;
      direction.y = verticalVal;

GetAxis
- public static float GetAxis(string axisName);
- to view axisName options, Edit > Project Settings > Input Manager
- diff axes help represent the different input devices
- Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"); tells Unity to find input value associated with horizontal axis

Digital signals
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxisRaw.html
- returns -1 (left/down), 0 (not moving), 1 (right/up)

Analog signals
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html
- returns continuous range from -1 to 1

Rigidbody2D
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html

Transform
- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html
- transforms position, rotation, and scale
- transform.up reference to the y axis (green axis)
